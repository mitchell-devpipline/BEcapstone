# BEcapstone

Welcome to Mitchell Nelsons BE Capstone.
I designed this BE application for an online grocery store that only sells whole foods.

Spin up the app using python app.py

Authenticate using the following info:
{
"email":"johndabomb@AOL.com",
"password":"1234"
}

An organization and user will be created when you run app.py

Get all your orgs so you can use the org id to create a meat then a produce item. Then you will create an order using all 4 of the other UUIDs (user, org, meat, produce)

Once you have created 1 of everything you can test the get by ID routes for all tables. User, produce, org, order, and meat.

They you will want to edit info on the items you have created.

Once you have successfully edited the items you can test the delete functionality.

Use the attached postman collection to run the app. Let me know if you have any questions.
